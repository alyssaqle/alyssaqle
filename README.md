## ðŸ§  About Me
I enjoy exploring how data can answer real-world questions and improve decision-making.  

Most of my work so far has been in **data analytics and machine learning projects** â€” building dashboards, cleaning and analyzing datasets, and applying machine learning models

Alongside this, Iâ€™m also exploring how analytics connects to **conversion, subscriptions, growth, and product decision-making** - areas I find exciting and want to deepen my skills in.  

To support this journey, Iâ€™m beginning to learn **data engineering tools and workflows** that make analytics and ML projects more scalable and impactful.
